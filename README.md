# Reminder
## Write different function in .h files to make the code readable
1. **basic.h**: Only headers
2. **Test function.h**: Provided by TA. Python version are also provided but not recommended due to the unpleasent efficiency.
3. **Function.h**: Read and write file function, also the plot function.
4. **DE.h**: Everything you need to run a DE (Differential Evolution) algorithm.
5. **main.cpp**: Execute the testing. Attention: I use chatgpt to help me run the test asynchronously for the purpose of saving time. The modification also affect the DE.h.

## Alert: The modification will use every core and thread of your cpu, be aware of the safety.
